## Used Extensions

### [SuluArticleBundle](https://github.com/sulu/SuluArticleBundle)

The SuluArticleBundle adds support for managing articles in Sulu. Articles can be used in a lot of different ways to manage unstructured data with an own URL in an admin-list.
Most of the features, which can be used in pages, can also be used on articles - like templates, versioning, drafting, publishing and automation.

### [SuluAutomationBundle](https://github.com/sulu/SuluAutomationBundle)

The SuluAutomationBundle provides a way to manages future tasks which can be scheduled for entities in the Sulu-Admin. For example schedule the publishing of a page to a specific datetime in the future.

To enable automated tasks use the command ``task:run`` manually in the terminal or in a cronjob. This tasks executes the
pending automation tasks (see [SuluAutomationBundle Installation Docs](https://github.com/sulu/SuluAutomationBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/installation.md)).

## Usage

Now you can try out our demo, there is no need to configure a virtual host. Just use the build in web servers:

php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public config/router.php
```

Then you can access the administration interface via [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin). The default user and password is “admin”.

The web frontend can be found under [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

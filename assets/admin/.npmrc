# the package.json in this folder uses a preinstall and postinstall script for symlinking the javascript code of the
# sulu/sulu package into the node_modules directory: https://github.com/sulu/sulu/blob/2.x/symlink-vendor-directory.js
# when executing npm as root (eg. inside a docker container), npm will drop permissions when executing these scripts
# and therefore the symlink cannot be created. to prevent dropping permissions, we enable the "unsafe-perm" setting
# https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts#user
unsafe-perm=true

# the javascript setup in this folder is not compatible with npm 7: https://github.com/sulu/skeleton/issues/88
# to display a helpful error message if an incompatible version is used, we enable the "engine-strict" setting
engine-strict=true
